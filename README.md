# Trendify - E-Commerce App

Trendify is a modern e-commerce web application built with **Next.js**, **Hygraph CMS** for content management, and **Chakra UI** for building a responsive and accessible user interface. This app follows the learning steps outlined in the book **"Real World Next.js"** by **Michele Riva**.

## Features
- Seamless e-commerce shopping experience
- Dynamic product catalog fetched from **Hygraph CMS**
- User-friendly and responsive UI built with **Chakra UI**
- Integration with **Next.js** for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and static site generation

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building optimized web applications with SSR and static site generation.
- **Hygraph CMS**: A flexible headless CMS to manage products and content.
- **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React.
- **Stripe** (optional for future integrations): For handling payments (if applicable).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
